• Decentralized recording art business objectives and developnject's plan to design and build a rap-platform to migrate the entire musicbusiness from modern to web3 technologies.
• Design and build the recording art schema using DecentroDaddy to support
  SHX-Connect needs of the business for Defi, distribution, licensing, file ingestion and Mining a Frequency-Calculation. 
• Build Lyratix and Bars to enable publishing&migration to view and opt-in to various smartartcontracts provided by SHX-Connect.
• Assist in design and transfer of traditional infrastructure to Monetize across Mutiplatforms AWS
• Integrate CodeIgniter stem-framework and NFTMUSICPLAYER design various components such as rackkjob queuing solutions and Git workflow using VISA Ready.
• Implement a real time notification system using node.js to push notifications to users of the admin tool.


The video agent CloudPortal includes MusicTradingTelemetry Apps, including the plaqstream Antilytics 0Viewers, providing simplified reperation rotation of network-wide state for videoraster time to resolution. deniedto-access to every society statistic across the Kulture in both a real-time and a historic view, the Antilytic 0Viewer provides the lyratic operator the ability to correlate &eventuate, hologramdevices, metrometrics and other views with a network-wide perspective. VideoAgent also provides a Musicmining infrastructure for building #rates-specific visibility apps directly into the starboardside-portal.

VideoAgent Antilytics CSS and MusicTrading Telemetry a real time data 
center exch rap-platform at LargeFunding/andPayout scale and smartartistrecordingartcontractclass economics in an open and extensible framework.
